# Mobile Image Enhancement through Image Style Transfer
 
This repository contains the code for the deep learning approach to image enhancement through image style transfer which takes an image from a low end smartphone and enhances it in the style of a higher end device.

## Sample Images

## Setup

1. Download the pre-trained [VGG-19 model](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0BwOLOmqkYj-jMGRwaUR2UjhSNDQ/view?usp=sharing) and put it into `vgg_pretrained/` folder.
2. Download the [mobile image pair dataset (MIPD)](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1CmDvlpZbZuoVQ8keSA-oIaZgVIo2ueI7) and extract it on the `images/` folder.
